 A quick hack to create a map that displays the itinerary of a road trip using Foursquare checkins.
 Info boxes on the markers on the Google Map show some of the foursquare info and flickr photos.
 Most everything has hard-coded parameters.

 -data.py
    Python script to get the Foursquare checkins and put the wanted ones in a javascript file
    It generates data.js.
 -flickrdata.js
    Hand made javascript file with the Flickr photos to add on the markers
 -ffmap.html
    HTML file displaying the map with the markers. Lots of hardcoded stuff in it too.
 -infobox.js, tipbox.gif: External resources for the info window on the markers
